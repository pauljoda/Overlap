# Simple CloudKit Integration for Overlaps

This document shows how to use the simplified SwiftData-CloudKit integration to access private database records for Overlap sharing functionality.

## Overview

The implementation provides a simple bridge between SwiftData and CloudKit's CKSyncEngine, allowing you to:
- Access private CloudKit records for Overlaps created by SwiftData
- Prepare Overlap records for sharing
- Monitor sync status
- Handle CloudKit availability

Based on: https://yingjiezhao.com/en/articles/Implementing-iCloud-Sync-by-Combining-SwiftData-with-CKSyncEngine/

## Key Components

### 1. CloudKitSyncManager
- Simple interface with CloudKit's CKSyncEngine
- Handles sync events for Overlap records only
- Provides access to private database records

### 2. SwiftDataCloudKitBridge
- Main service for coordinating SwiftData and CloudKit
- Provides high-level methods for accessing Overlap records
- Manages sync status and availability

### 3. CloudKitSyncable Protocol
- Simple protocol for CloudKit record tracking
- Handles record conversion and conflict resolution using `lastKnownRecord`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup

The integration is automatically set up in your app:

```swift
// In OverlapApp.swift - already implemented
@StateObject private var cloudKitBridge: SwiftDataCloudKitBridge

// The bridge is available throughout your app via environment
@Environment(\.swiftDataCloudKitBridge) private var cloudKitBridge
```

### Accessing CloudKit Records for Overlaps

```swift
// Get CloudKit record for a specific overlap
func prepareOverlapForSharing(_ overlap: Overlap) async {
    guard let bridge = cloudKitBridge else { return }
    
    do {
        // This gets the actual CloudKit record from the private database
        let record = try await bridge.getCloudKitRecord(for: overlap)
        
        // Now you can use this record for CloudKit sharing
        print("Record ID: \(record?.recordID.recordName ?? "none")")
        print("Record Type: \(record?.recordType ?? "none")")
        
    } catch {
        print("Failed to get CloudKit record: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### Preparing for Sharing

```swift
// Prepare an overlap for sharing
func shareOverlap(_ overlap: Overlap) async {
    guard let bridge = cloudKitBridge else { return }
    
    do {
        // This method returns the CloudKit record for sharing
        let record = try await bridge.prepareForSharing(overlap)
        
        // Now you can create a CloudKit share with this record
        await createCloudKitShare(for: record)
        
    } catch {
        print("Failed to prepare for sharing: \(error)")
    }
}

func createCloudKitShare(for record: CKRecord) async {
    // Your CloudKit sharing implementation would go here
    // You now have access to the actual private database record
    // that SwiftData created and syncs
}
```

### Monitoring Sync Status

```swift
struct SomeView: View {
    @Environment(\.swiftDataCloudKitBridge) private var cloudKitBridge
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if cloudKitBridge?.isCloudKitAvailable == true {
                Text("CloudKit Available")
                    .foregroundColor(.green)
            } else {
                Text("CloudKit Unavailable")
                    .foregroundColor(.red)
            }
            
            switch cloudKitBridge?.syncStatus {
            case .idle:
                Text("Sync: Idle")
            case .syncing:
                Text("Sync: In Progress")
            case .error:
                Text("Sync: Error")
            case .none:
                Text("Sync: Unknown")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Getting All Overlap Records

```swift
// Get all CloudKit records for Overlaps
func getAllOverlapRecords() async {
    guard let bridge = cloudKitBridge else { return }
    
    do {
        let records = try await bridge.getAllOverlapRecords()
        print("Found \(records.count) overlap records in CloudKit")
        
        for record in records {
            print("- \(record.recordID.recordName): \(record["title"] as? String ?? "Untitled")")
        }
        
    } catch {
        print("Failed to get records: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Demo View

A complete demo is available in `CloudKitSyncDemoView.swift` that shows:
- CloudKit availability status
- Sync status monitoring
- Record access for Overlaps
- Error handling

## Configuration

The implementation uses:
- **Domain**: `com.pauljoda.overlap`
- **CloudKit Container**: `iCloud.com.pauljoda.overlap`
- **Record Type**: `Overlap`
- **Zone**: `Overlap`

## Key Benefits

1. **Simple**: Focused only on Overlap records
2. **SwiftData Compatible**: Your existing SwiftData code continues to work unchanged
3. **Private Record Access**: You can access the CloudKit records that SwiftData creates
4. **Sharing Ready**: Records are properly prepared for CloudKit sharing
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Built-in handling using `lastKnownRecord` from the tutorial

## Next Steps for Sharing Implementation

With this foundation, you can now:

1. **Create CloudKit Shares**: Use the private Overlap records to create `CKShare` objects
2. **Handle Share Invitations**: Process incoming share invitations for Overlaps
3. **Manage Shared Records**: Handle Overlap records that are shared vs private
4. **Sync Shared Data**: Coordinate between private and shared databases for Overlaps

The key advantage is that you now have access to the actual CloudKit Overlap records that SwiftData manages, allowing you to implement sharing on top of your existing SwiftData architecture.
