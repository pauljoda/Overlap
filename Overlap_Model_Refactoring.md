# Overlap Model Refactoring

## Overview
The `Overlap.swift` file has been refactored from a single 808-line file into a clean, modular structure with focused responsibilities.

## File Structure

### Core Model
- **`Overlap.swift`** (202 lines) - Contains only SwiftData properties, computed properties, and the core designated initializer

### Extensions
- **`Overlap+Analysis.swift`** (83 lines) - Analysis and reporting methods
- **`Overlap+Initialization.swift`** (117 lines) - Convenience initializers
- **`Overlap+QuestionManagement.swift`** (29 lines) - Question lookup and management
- **`Overlap+Randomization.swift`** (93 lines) - Question randomization logic
- **`Overlap+ResponseManagement.swift`** (93 lines) - Response saving and retrieval
- **`Overlap+SessionManagement.swift`** (162 lines) - Session flow and state management

### Shared Components
- **`ColorCustomization.swift`** (79 lines) - Shared protocol for color handling used by both `Overlap` and `Questionnaire`

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Removed Debug/Testing Code**
- Eliminated all debug print statements
- Removed `printQuestionOrders()` debug method
- Cleaned up testing-specific code

### 2. **Eliminated Code Duplication**
- Created `ColorCustomizable` protocol to share color handling logic between `Overlap` and `Questionnaire`
- Both models now use the same color conversion and storage logic

### 3. **Better Organization**
- Each extension has a focused responsibility
- Related methods are grouped together
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. **Preserved SwiftData Compatibility**
- All SwiftData properties remain in the main model file
- Internal storage remains unchanged to maintain database compatibility
- All computed properties work exactly as before

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability** - Each file is now focused and easier to understand
2. **Readability** - The main model file is much cleaner and shows the core structure clearly
3. **Modularity** - Related functionality is grouped together in extensions
4. **Reusability** - Color handling logic is now shared between models
5. **Debugging** - Easier to locate specific functionality when troubleshooting

## Migration Notes

- No changes to public API - all existing code will continue to work
- SwiftData properties and relationships are unchanged
- All functionality has been preserved, just reorganized
- The same initializers are available (moved to `Overlap+Initialization.swift`)

## Usage

The model works exactly the same as before:

```swift
// Creating an overlap works the same way
let overlap = Overlap(
    questionnaire: myQuestionnaire,
    participants: ["Alice", "Bob"],
    randomizeQuestions: true
)

// All methods are still available
overlap.saveResponse(answer: .yes)
let responses = overlap.getQuestionsWithResponses()
```

The only difference is that the implementation is now spread across focused files instead of being in one large file.
