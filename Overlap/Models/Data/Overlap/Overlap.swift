/// A comprehensive overlap session that handles questionnaire flow and response tracking
///
/// This class encapsulates the entire overlap experience including questionnaire structure,
/// participant responses, session management, and randomization features. It provides a
/// clean interface for managing the questionnaire session without exposing internal
/// index management or coupling between questions and answers.
///
/// ## Key Features
/// - **Session Management**: Tracks current participant and question progress
/// - **Response Storage**: Maintains participant responses
/// - **Question Randomization**: Optional feature to randomize question order per participant
/// - **Progress Tracking**: Monitors completion status and session flow
/// - **Analysis Tools**: Methods for extracting and analyzing response data
///
/// ## Randomization Feature
/// The session supports question randomization where each participant receives the same questions
/// in a different random order. This helps eliminate order bias in responses.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// // Create overlap with randomization enabled
/// let overlap = Overlap(
///     questionnaire: myQuestionnaire,
///     participants: ["Alice", "Bob"],
///     randomizeQuestions: true
/// )
///
/// // Alice might see: ["Question 3", "Question 1", "Question 2"]
/// // Bob might see: ["Question 2", "Question 3", "Question 1"]
///
/// // Responses are still stored consistently by original question index
/// // so analysis works correctly across all participants
/// ```
